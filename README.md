vMAT
====

The **vMAT** library implements a grab-bag of mathematical functions inspired by **MATLAB**[^fn].

This library is being developed as part of a facial recognition project. As such, it
contains a small (but growing) set of matrix functions and related utilities which that project happens to use.
The project is still in an early, pre-release state right now, but stay tuned...

For an idea of what is to come, have a look at the first draft of [The vMAT Manifesto](http://kaelin.github.io/posts/the-vmat-manifesto/).


## matxd

**matxd** is a command-line tool for exploring the layout of the binary `.mat` file format of **MATLAB**.
It's still in development right now, and not terribly useful for anything beyond validating the
`.mat` reading code in the **vMAT** library (which is _also_ a work-in-progress).
